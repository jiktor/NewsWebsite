            <p>In this project I have tried to create a simplified version of website for news with mvc architecture.
                In order to do so I have used SpringBoot with thymleaf.
                All the data is stored in MySQL database. There are three
                types of user roles: AUTHOR,ADMIN,USER. When a new User is
                registered he is automatically given the USER user role. In order for user to recieve
                other roles an admin has to grant them to him. Different user roles give the following possibilities to users:
                USER - Can read published articles and write comments;
                AUTHOR - Can publish articles;
                ADMIN - Can edit user's user roles and delete accounts.
                For authentication and authorization I have used spring security.
                Since I am mostly interested in back end development the site's front end
                isn't as good as it should be but I will try to fix it in the future.</p>
